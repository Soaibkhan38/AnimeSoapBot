#Not Important stuff: If you know me, you know how lazy I can be. I spend a lot of time coding and recently came across the wonders of rss. I do anime encoding and weekly releases can be a bit tiring. So, I firstly automated downloading episodes via rss on qBittorrent. Now, I couldn't automate encoding (for now), so I decided to automate release alerts. 
We encoders use telegram for communication. So, no other platform could have been better for release alerts.
